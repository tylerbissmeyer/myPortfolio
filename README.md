My Code Louisville front End Project
For my final project I wanted to build a simple portfolio website for my freelance photography business. 
I wanted the site to be responsive with large photos utilizing a clean minimalist design.  I wanted the 
photography work to standout, not being overshadowed by design features. 


  For my about page, I found inspiration for the interactive Gif bio. from a webpage I viewed on www.awwwards.com. 
  In efforts to emulate the about page I viewed, I used CSS animation and JavaScript to slide my bio into the frame 
  when the user clicks the Gif. 


This website served as a starting point for me.  This was my first attempt at building a website from the ground up.
I plan on making the site more dynamic and intend on adding more features. Thanks for taking the time to review my work!
